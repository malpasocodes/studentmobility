        Welcome to the student mobility dashboard. This dashboard allows you to explore data on economic mobility at different types of colleges in the United States.
        The dashboard is work in progress. Please see the **About** page for more information.

        Our aim is to stimulate discussion, particulary on the following questions:

        1. **Which colleges are top performers for social mobility?**
        2. **Are elite colleges truly meritocratic or do they mostly serve the wealthy?**
